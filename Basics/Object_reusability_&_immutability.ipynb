    "## Object reusability & Immutability\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Object reusability: \n",
    "##### In Python, when we create an object, it is stored in memory and can be reused again without recreating it. This concept is called \"object reusability\".\n",
    "##### The main use case of object reusability is to optimize memory usage and improve performance by reusing existing objects instead of creating new ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Some use cases of object reusability in Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Caching: Caching is a technique used to store the results of expensive computations so that they can be reused in subsequent executions. By caching results, we can avoid redundant computations and improve the performance of our programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Flyweight pattern: The flyweight pattern is a design pattern that aims to minimize memory usage by sharing as much data as possible between similar objects. By reusing objects, we can reduce the memory footprint of our program and improve its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Object pooling: Object pooling is a technique used to manage a pool of reusable objects that can be used by multiple threads or processes. By reusing objects, we can reduce the overhead of object creation and destruction and improve the scalability of our program.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Overall, object reusability is a powerful technique for optimizing memory usage and improving performance in Python programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### All fundamental objects are immutable but not all of them are reusable.\n",
    "##### 1) Bool type\n",
    "##### 2) int [] -5 to 256 integers are reusable\n",
    "##### 3) All string objects are reusable [By default string including digits(0-9) and alphabets(a-z, A-Z) are reusable.]"
